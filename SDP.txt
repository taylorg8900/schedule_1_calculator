needed functionality:
- if the effect being added is already one of the ones provided, then the actual value is going to be less than expected so factor that in too

how to solve this?

I basically need some kind of data structure which remembers all of the information from the effect_list file
and if the thing that the algorithm comes to won't work, it will remove that piece of information from it. So
I need to not use the file itself. I need to turn the file into a dictionary or something. Maybe a dictionary of lists.
Either a dictionary or a list. I don't know what I'm thinking because I am super tired right now. Maybe I could have a big
list where each element is each line from the file, and we remove that line if it no worky. What was the keyword for
retrying a loop? I don't think it was continue. Oh well. I will figure it out tomorrow.
